# Face Emotion Recognition

## Overview
Face Emotion Recognition is a project that leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and classify emotions from facial expressions. This application can be used for mood analysis, user experience improvement, and more.

## Features
- Real-time emotion detection from facial images or live webcam feed.
- Classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, and more.
- Easy-to-use interface for quick setup and usage.
- Pretrained model integration for efficient emotion recognition.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For facial detection and image preprocessing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the emotion recognition model.
- **Flask/Django** (if applicable): For backend API (if used).

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kinshuk8/Face-Emotion-Recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Face-Emotion-Recognition
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Use your webcam or load an image to test emotion detection.

## How It Works
1. **Face Detection**: The system uses OpenCV's Haar cascades or DNN models to detect faces in images or video streams.
2. **Preprocessing**: Extracted face regions are resized and normalized.
3. **Emotion Classification**: The preprocessed images are passed to a CNN model trained on labeled datasets to classify emotions.
4. **Output**: Displays detected emotions with bounding boxes around faces.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance accuracy by training on a larger and more diverse dataset.
- Add support for detecting multiple faces and emotions in a single frame.
- Integrate the project into a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.
